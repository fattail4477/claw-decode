 * description and attachments.ts emits an agent_listing_delta attachment.
 *
 * The dynamic agent list was ~10.2% of fleet cache_creation tokens: MCP async
 * connect, /reload-plugins, or permission-mode changes mutate the list →
 * description changes → full tool-schema cache bust.
 *
 * Override with CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_LIST_IN_MESSAGES=true/false for testing.

## When to fork

Fork yourself (omit \`subagent_type\`) when the intermediate tool output isn't worth keeping in your context. The criterion is qualitative \u2014 "will I need this output again" \u2014 not task size.
- **Research**: fork open-ended questions. If research can be broken into independent questions, launch parallel forks in one message. A fork beats a fresh subagent for this \u2014 it inherits context and shares your cache.
- **Implementation**: prefer to fork implementation work that requires more than a couple of edits. Do research before jumping to implementation.

Forks are cheap because they share your prompt cache. Don't set \`model\` on a fork \u2014 a different model can't reuse the parent's cache. Pass a short \`name\` (one or two words, lowercase) so the user can see the fork in the teams panel and steer it mid-run.

**Don't peek.** The tool result includes an \`output_file\` path — do not Read or tail it unless the user explicitly asks for a progress check. You get a completion notification; trust it. Reading the transcript mid-flight pulls the fork's tool noise into your context, which defeats the point of forking.

**Don't race.** After launching, you know nothing about what the fork found. Never fabricate or predict fork results in any format — not as prose, summary, or structured output. The notification arrives as a user-role message in a later turn; it is never something you write yourself. If the user asks a follow-up before the notification lands, tell them the fork is still running — give status, not a guess.

**Writing a fork prompt.** Since the fork inherits your context, the prompt is a *directive* — what to do, not what the situation is. Be specific about scope: what's in, what's out, what another agent is handling. Don't re-explain background.

## Writing the prompt

${forkEnabled ? 'When spawning a fresh agent (with a `subagent_type`), it starts with zero context. ' : ''}Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.
